# fashion-mnist-mlp

Hello guys, this is the version of "MLP" or what people call too "DNN" in Keras (not so deep, only 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer). It is a fully connected neural network with architecture: (728-256-128-100-10). Since Fashion Mnist is Mnist dataset like, the images are 28x28x1, so the first layer is 28*28 = 728, and the last one is the 10 classes to classify.
